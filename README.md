# IPV6AddressesInAVLTree
The purpose of these files is that it makes a server-client Application that stores and displays IPV6 addresses and the countries they belong to. The client will take in the IPV6 addresses range (From, To) and the country those addresses are assigned to and sends them to the server (UDP). The Server takes the input from client and stores the addresses range and country in an AVL Tree. Also, when the client side user wants to know which country an address belongs to, he can choose to display the country option and give in his IPV6 address. This will make the client take in the IPV6 address and send it to the server who would search in the AVL tree and replies the client with the Country name, which the client would display to the user.
To use it, just copy all files into a folder and give a 'make' which would compile all the files and gives two executables - server_main and client_main
