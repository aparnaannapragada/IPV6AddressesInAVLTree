# IPV6AddressesInAVLTree
The purpose of these files that makes a server client Application is to store and display IPV6 addresses and the countries they belong to. The client will take in the IPV6 addresses range (From, To) and the country those addresses are assigned to and sends them to server (UDP). The Server takes the input from client and stores the addresses range and country in an AVL Tree. Also, when the client side user want to know which country an address belongs to, he can choose display the country option and give in his IPV6 address. This will make the client to take in the IPV6 address and send it to the server who would search in the AVL tree and replies the client with the Country name, which the client would display to the user.
To use it, just copy all files into a folder and give a 'make' which would compile all the files and gives two executables - server_main and client_main
